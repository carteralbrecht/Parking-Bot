# Parking Bot

Parking Bot is a twitter bot written as a python script that sends a tweet containing real-time information and updates regarding the University of Central Florida parking garages. This script is designed to be ran automatically in a pre-defined schedule. The data is scraped from the official UCF website containing parking garage data.

The official Parking Bot Twitter account can be found at [@UCFGarage](https://www.twitter.com/UCFGarage)


## Usage

To run this script, the user must first gain access to the Twitter API and store their API and Access Token keys/secrets in a module named twitter_auth.py

```parking_bot.py``` can then be run by Python manually or automatically (through scheduling tools such as cron)

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome.

## Motivations
The purpose of this project was to gain experience with python, get familiar with using the Twitter API, and to provide my peers with a convenient way to easily secure a parking spot on campus.
